Let's walk through an example where you have a single Terraform state file managing two local `null_resource` instances, and you want to split this into two separate Terraform repositories, each managing one of the `null_resource` instances.

### Initial Setup

#### Initial Configuration

Assume you have the following configuration in a single directory/repository:

```hcl
# main.tf
provider "local" {}

resource "null_resource" "resource_a" {
  triggers = {
    message = "This is resource A"
  }
}

resource "null_resource" "resource_b" {
  triggers = {
    message = "This is resource B"
  }
}
```

Assume your initial state file is `terraform.tfstate` in the current directory.

### Step-by-Step Migration

#### Step 1: Backup the State

```bash
cp terraform.tfstate terraform.tfstate.backup
```

#### Step 2: Create New Repositories

Create two new directories representing the new repositories. Let's call them `repo_a` and `repo_b`.

```bash
mkdir repo_a repo_b
```

#### Step 3: Copy Configuration Files

Copy the relevant parts of the configuration to each new directory.

- **repo_a/main.tf:**

  ```hcl
  provider "local" {}

  resource "null_resource" "resource_a" {
    triggers = {
      message = "This is resource A"
    }
  }
  ```

- **repo_b/main.tf:**

  ```hcl
  provider "local" {}

  resource "null_resource" "resource_b" {
    triggers = {
      message = "This is resource B"
    }
  }
  ```

#### Step 4: Initialize New Repositories

Navigate to each repository and initialize Terraform.

```bash
cd repo_a
terraform init

cd ../repo_b
terraform init
```

#### Step 5: Move Resources Using `terraform state mv`

Return to the original directory where your state file is located and execute the following commands to move each resource to its respective state file:

- For `repo_a`:

  ```bash
  terraform state mv -state-out=../repo_a/terraform.tfstate null_resource.resource_a null_resource.resource_a
  ```

- For `repo_b`:

  ```bash
  terraform state mv -state-out=../repo_b/terraform.tfstate null_resource.resource_b null_resource.resource_b
  ```

#### Step 6: Verify and Apply

Navigate to each repository, and run `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` to ensure the resources are correctly managed in their new repositories.

- In `repo_a`:

  ```bash
  cd ../repo_a
  terraform plan
  terraform apply
  ```

- In `repo_b`:

  ```bash
  cd ../repo_b
  terraform plan
  terraform apply
  ```

#### Final Check

Ensure that the resources are correctly managed in their respective repositories and that both plans and applies run without error.

### Final Cleanup

After verifying that everything is working correctly, you can remove the original configuration files and the old state file.

```bash
rm -rf ../original_directory
```

### Documentation Update

Update any documentation to reflect the new repository structure, explaining which resources are managed by each repository and how they interrelate if needed.

By following these steps, you will have successfully split your Terraform state and configurations into two separate repositories, each managing its own set of resources.
