You can practice with Terraform on your local machine without any external dependencies. Terraform has a built-in provisioner called "local-exec" that allows you to execute a local command. You can use it to understand Terraform's core concepts like providers, resources, variables, outputs, etc.

Here is a simple example:

1. Create a new directory for your Terraform project.

```bash
mkdir terraform-local
cd terraform-local
```

2. Create a new file called `main.tf` in the directory you just created.

```bash
touch main.tf
```

3. Open `main.tf` in a text editor, and add the following code:

```hcl
variable "my_var" {
  type    = string
  default = "Hello, World!"
}

resource "null_resource" "example" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo ${var.my_var}"
  }
}

output "my_output" {
  value = var.my_var
}
```
This configuration defines a variable, uses it in a local command, and outputs it.

4. Initialize your Terraform working directory:

```bash
terraform init
```

5. Apply your Terraform configuration:

```bash
terraform apply
```

This command creates your resource as defined in `main.tf`. Terraform will display what actions will be taken before asking for confirmation. If everything looks good, answer `yes`.

6. You should see the output of the command `echo ${var.my_var}` executed, and also the value of `my_output` with the same `Hello, World!` message.

Remember to delete the resources when you're done testing:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

This is a very basic example of how to use Terraform's local-exec provisioner, variables, and outputs. Depending on what you want to practice, you might need to adjust your Terraform configuration accordingly.
