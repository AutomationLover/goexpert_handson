Here are a few debugging steps you can follow:

1. **System Logs**: You can view these logs through the AWS Management Console. 

- Go to the Amazon EC2 console, and then navigate to 'Instances'.
- Select the instance, and then choose 'Actions'.
- Under 'Instance Settings', choose 'Get System Log'.

This log provides details about your instance that can be useful in troubleshooting problems with instance startup.

2. **Cloud-Init Logs**: If you used cloud-init directives in your user data, you should look at the cloud-init logs.

- These logs are usually located in `/var/log/cloud-init.log` and `/var/log/cloud-init-output.log`.
- You can view these logs by SSHing into your instance.

3. **Check cloud-init status**: You can check the status of cloud-init with the command `cloud-init status`. If it's not done yet, it's a sign that scripts are still running or that cloud-init is stuck.
