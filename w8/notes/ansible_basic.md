Ansible is an open-source automation tool, or platform, used for IT tasks such as configuration management, application deployment, intraservice orchestration, and provisioning. An Ansible Playbook is essentially a set of instructions that you send to run on one, or more, remote servers. It's a script written in YAML, which defines a set of tasks that are to be run on managed hosts. 

The playbook consists of many elements, and the most essential ones are 'hosts' and 'tasks'. The 'hosts' section defines on which hosts the playbook will run. The 'tasks' section is a list of actions you want to execute. A single playbook can contain multiple plays.

Here's a simple example of a playbook:

```yaml
---
- name: Install apache server
  hosts: webservers
  tasks:
     - name: ensure apache is at the latest version
       yum:
         name: httpd
         state: latest
     - name: ensure apache is running
       service:
         name: httpd
         state: started
```
In this example, the playbook is designed to install an Apache server on a group named 'webservers'. First task ensures that the latest version of Apache is installed, and the second task ensures that the Apache service is running. 

In essence, a playbook performs the following steps:
1. It defines a playbook with "---" at the start.
2. It specifies a name for the set of tasks.
3. It identifies the hosts. In this example, it's "webservers".
4. It defines tasks. Each task is given a name and then specifies a module. In this example, it uses the 'yum' module to ensure the latest version of Apache is installed, and the 'service' module to ensure the service is running.

Playbooks can be very detailed, and could include things like variables, handlers and more. For example, if you want to add variable for httpd package:

```yaml
---
- name: Install apache server
  hosts: webservers
  vars:
    httpd_package: httpd
  tasks:
     - name: ensure apache is at the latest version
       yum:
         name: "{{ httpd_package }}"
         state: latest
     - name: ensure apache is running
       service:
         name: "{{ httpd_package }}"
         state: started
```
In this example, 'httpd_package' is a variable, which can be used throughout the playbook to refer to the Apache server package. The "{{ }}" is used to denote variables in Ansible.

Using Ansible Playbooks, you can manage configurations and deployments on remote machines in a structured and repeatable manner. You just need to write a playbook and run it using the ansible-playbook command. For instance:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```
This command will run the playbook named "playbook.yml".

Remember to follow the YAML syntax strictly, as YAML is very sensitive to white-spaces and indentation. Also, always start your playbook with "---".

By using Ansible playbooks, you gain the ability to script your infrastructure, allowing everyone on the team to use, understand and modify infrastructure management, and to version control it just like application code.
