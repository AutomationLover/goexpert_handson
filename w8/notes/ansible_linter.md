Ansible Lint is a command-line tool for linting playbooks, roles and collections aimed towards any Ansible users. Its main goal is to promote code standards and best practices, focusing on simplicity and ease of use.

The commands you've mentioned are commonly used for testing and debugging Ansible scripts:

1. `ansible-playbook --check --diff`: This command checks the playbook for any errors without making any changes to the remote systems. The `--check` option enables the check mode, while the `--diff` option shows the differences between the current and proposed states.

2. `ansible-playbook --syntax-check`: This command checks the syntax of the playbook for any errors. It can help catch any syntax errors before the playbook is executed.

3. `ansible-lint`: This command is used to test the best practices and policies in your Ansible code. It's a tool for checking common mistakes and ensuring a playbook follows the recommended guidelines.

These commands are essential for maintaining high-quality Ansible scripts and ensuring their smooth execution. They help in identifying and rectifying any errors or issues before the actual execution of the playbook, thus saving time and preventing potential system issues.
