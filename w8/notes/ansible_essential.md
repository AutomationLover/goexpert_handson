1. Understanding Ansible: Ansible is an open-source automation tool, or platform, used for IT tasks such as configuration management, application deployment, intraservice orchestration, and provisioning.

2. Ansible CLI (Command Line Interface): This is a tool that helps in communicating with the Ansible server. The basic command syntax is 'ansible [pattern] -m [module] -a [args]'.

3. Ansible Playbooks: These are a way to send commands to remote computers in a scripted way. They are written in YAML format (Yet Another Markup Language).

4. Writing Playbooks: A playbook consists of one or more 'plays' in a list. The goal of a play is to map a group of hosts to some well-defined roles, represented by tasks.

Here are the main components of an Ansible playbook:

   - Hosts: Specifies on which hosts the tasks should run on.
   - Variables: Data that can be used and reused across the playbook.
   - Tasks: The list of tasks that the playbook will execute.
   - Handlers: These are tasks that only run when notified.
   - Templates: Feature of Ansible that uses Jinja2 templating to dynamically create files.
   
5. Running Playbooks: Play books are run using the 'ansible-playbook' command followed by the options and the playbook name, for example, 'ansible-playbook playbook.yml'. 

6. YAML Syntax: Understanding the YAML syntax is crucial to writing playbooks. YAML uses indentation to denote structure, similar to Python. Key-value pairs are separated by a colon, and list items are preceded by a dash.

7. Modules: Ansible uses modules to perform system tasks on the remote system. For example, file, command, yum, apt, etc. Each module can be used in a task to accomplish different system setup operations.

8. Inventories: An inventory is a list of nodes or hosts (remote servers) on which tasks should be run. It's an initialization file that contains information about the servers you are managing.

9. Variables: Variables, represented as 'vars' in playbooks, are used to manage differences between systems. They can be defined in a variety of places and have different priorities.

10. Conditionals: Ansible uses conditionals to control the execution flow of the playbook. They are used to decide whether to run or skip a particular task based on a condition.

11. Looping: Looping is used when you want to perform an operation multiple times like creating multiple users, installing multiple packages, etc. 'loop', 'with_items', 'with_dict' are commonly used for looping in Ansible.

12. Error Handling: Ansible allows you to handle errors in a playbook to prevent the playbook execution from stopping.

13. Roles: Roles provide a way of bundling automation content and making it reusable. Each role is limited to a particular functionality or desired output, and can be reused as many times as needed.

14. Ansible Vault: This is a feature of Ansible that allows you to keep sensitive data, like passwords or keys in encrypted files, rather than as plaintext in playbooks or roles.

15. Debugging: Ansible offers several methods for debugging a playbook, you can use the debug module to print out variables or messages.

Remember, practice is key in mastering Ansible. Start by writing simple playbooks and gradually increase the complexity as you get comfortable.
